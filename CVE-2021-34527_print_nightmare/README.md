This audit file was created by modifying an audit file published by Tenable to suite my needs to check for registery settings as well as checking to see if the print spooler was enabled.
The wording for the solution was kept from the Tenable published audit file since it was the same as the text published by Microsoft.

The file created by Tenable can be found here: https://github.com/tenable/audit_files/blob/master/cve-2021-34527/CVE-2021-34527.audit.
